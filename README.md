# Instagram-User-Analytics
# DESCRIPTION: 
The project is based on Instagram user analytics. I am going to find the following 
tasks 
I. Five oldest users on the Instagram.
II. The users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.
III. The user who gets more likes for a single photo.
IV. The top 5 most commonly used hashtags on Instagram.
V. What day of the week do most users register on.
VI. How many times does average user posts on Instagram. And also, the total 
number of photos on Instagram/total number of users.
VII. The data on users (bots) who have liked every single photo on the site.
from the provided database.

# APPROACH:
1) I gather the information from the description provided i.e., which tasks I 
 need to complete.
2) Using MYSQL Workbench I created new files and I started writing my queries to 
achieve the result.
3) Later I executed the Queries and if there are any errors in the code, I modified 
the code and fix the code without any errors.
4) I Revised the code once after completion of execution.
5) Finally, I attached my code to the file.

# TECH STACK:
❖ SQL
❖ Development tool – MYSQL Workbench version 8.0.30.
The main purpose of using MySQL workbench is that it provides the console to 
simply editable and administer to the MYSQL environments and to gain better 
results and insights of the data. It provides data modeling, SQL development and 
connecting servers and is the best tool to design, generate and managing the 
databases.

# CONCLUSION:
From the project We can learn how to analyze the users data and what’s the user 
analysis process and how the data analysts analyze the user information and 
statistics, it also helps to gain knowledge on how to perform some operations to acquire the 
required result.

Hence we analyzed the case study and executed the queries to acquire the required result.
